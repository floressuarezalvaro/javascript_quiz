# Javascript Quiz

## Repository

This webpage is meant to challenge your javascript knowledge. I've also thrown a Yoda theme to spice things up.

On this page, you'll be put through a series of 5 different questions, while also being timed. Any time you respond incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer... no pressure though. The galaxy only depends on you!

I've added this to my portfolio so feel free to also browse around and don't hestitate to contact me!

Below I'll include a screenshot of what the page looks like.
